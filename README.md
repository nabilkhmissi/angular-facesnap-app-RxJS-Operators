# FaceSnaps application

this is a simple angular application using RxJS library to fetch and manipulate data.
We decomposed our application into serveral modules to implement the lazy loading : 
- the appliction is composed as following : 
- - Core Module
- - Shared Module
- - Feature Module
- We used a simple HTTP interceptor so we can get token and data from the header of each request :

## used RxJS operators : 
- Observables
- map
- tap
- switchMap

## run the backend server
run the backend server using : npm i -> npm start
